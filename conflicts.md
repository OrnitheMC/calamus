## Conflict Resolution

When updating mappings, Stitch might encounter conflicts. This happens when a method inherits
multiple names from the previous version. Stitch will list all the options for you to choose from.

If you are re-generating the mappings, find the entry for the conflict in this file, and enter
the option that is written in **bold**. If the indices do not match what Stitch listed for you,
pick the option where the method inheritance matches the entry listed here. If there is no matching
method inheritance, report the issue [here](https://github.com/OrnitheMC/calamus/issues).

If you are generating new mappings, first check if the conflict can be resolved by an update to
our matches. If not, add a new entry for the conflict resolution to this file.
